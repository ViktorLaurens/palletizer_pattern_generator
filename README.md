# palletizer_pattern_generator
Palletizing boxes is an important task in the logistics industry, and specifying the placing pattern of the boxes is still oftentimes done manually. Letâ€™s change that!

This project aims to automate the process of determining the optimal arrangement of boxes on a pallet to maximize space utilization. By leveraging efficient algorithms and visualization tools, the program generates optimal packing patterns and provides insights into space utilization.

## About the Project
Efficiently palletizing boxes is crucial in logistics for maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs. This project provides a solution to calculate optimal 2D packing patterns for boxes on a pallet. The program considers various box dimensions and orientations to generate the best packing strategy.

### Key Features:
- **Greedy Search Algorithm**: Optimizes the placement of boxes to maximize the number of boxes that fit.
- **Support for Multiple Box Sizes**: Handles cases with one or more box types and calculates optimal placement.
- **Visualization**: Displays the packing patterns with distinct colors for different box types.
- **Reusability**: Modular design allows easy customization for different pallet and box dimensions.

## Documentation
The documentation for the project is available [here](#documentation). It includes details about the algorithms. Usage instructions, and examples can be found [here](#usage-and-examples).
