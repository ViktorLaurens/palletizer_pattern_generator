# palletizer_pattern_generator
Palletizing boxes is an important task in the logistics industry, and specifying the placing pattern of the boxes is still oftentimes done manually. Letâ€™s change that!

This project aims to automate the process of determining the optimal arrangement of boxes on a pallet to maximize space utilization. By leveraging efficient algorithms and visualization tools, the program generates optimal packing patterns and provides insights into space utilization.

## About the Project
Efficiently palletizing boxes is crucial in logistics for maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs. This project provides a solution to calculate optimal 2D packing patterns for boxes on a pallet. The program considers various box dimensions and orientations to generate the best packing strategy.

### Key Features:
- **Greedy Search Algorithm**: Optimizes the placement of boxes to maximize the number of boxes that fit.
- **Support for Multiple Box Sizes**: Handles cases with one or more box types and calculates optimal placement.
- **Visualization**: Displays the packing patterns with distinct colors for different box types.
- **Reusability**: Modular design allows easy customization for different pallet and box dimensions.

## Documentation
The documentation for the project is available [here](#documentation). It includes details about the algorithms. Usage instructions, and examples can be found [here](#usage-and-examples).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Git (install the latest version of Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- Python 3.8 or higher (install the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- pip

### Setup Instructions
For installation on your local device, open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory to clone the project from GitHub. Then perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local device:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ViktorLaurens/palletizer_pattern_generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd palletizer_pattern_generator
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment: 
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows: 
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
      ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install dependencies: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Install the project in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

*Note: For Windows users, if you're not authorized to run scripts, enable execution by running:*
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

## Run the Project Locally
After installation, run the project using the following command:
```bash
python -m ppg
```

## Usage and examples
When you run the command above in the terminal, you will be greeted with the following prompt:

The menu shows you the options you have. Entering 1, 2, 3 or 4 will calculate the optimal stacking pattern for the given pallet and box size. Each time the solution is visualized. Here are the visualizations:  

For a pallet with dimensions (W=120cm, L=100cm) and a box with size (W=22cm, L=17cm), the solution is:

For a pallet with dimensions (W=120cm, L=100cm) and a box with size (W=20cm, L=10cm), the solution is: 
![Screenshot](res/figure_2.png)

For a pallet with dimensions (W=70cm, L=60cm) and a box with size (W=40cm, L=30cm), the solution is: 
![Screenshot](res/figure_3.png)

For a pallet with dimensions (W=120cm, L=100cm) and two different boxes with sizes (W=40cm, L=30cm) and (W=22cm, L=17cm), the solution when prioritizing the bigger box is:

## Running Tests
To run the tests in the `tests/` folder, run the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

Running pytest in the terminal should output the following:
